<p>It’s a cg movie, and a relatively early one at that, and it’s worth noting that the visuals have not held up very well at all, so you may risk your son or daughter thinking it looks old and dated, and to be fair, it does. Kids in mind broke down the movie it using this system, and rated it a four out of 10 for sex/nudity, an eight out of 10 for violence/gore, and a nine for profanity. I would also recommend that anyone who has not watched this movie to watch it with someone else. The foul language was probably the most uncomfortable parts, but there are adult situations and themes that could make you uncomfortable as a parent, like suicide for example. Is the movie it appropriate for a 12 year old? I respect that competely, and only want her to watch movies that are appropriate for her age and our family decisions.</p>

<p>, Parents need to know that dune is based on frank herbert�s epic 1965 novel (previously adapted for the big screen in 1984 and for tv in 2000).
