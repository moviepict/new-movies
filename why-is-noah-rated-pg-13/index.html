<p>The Notebook movie review &amp; film summary (2004) Roger Ebert, The creator warns noah (russell crowe) that life on earth will be extinguished in a great flood and provides instructions on how to build a large ark to save his family and a pair of each animal species at their current stage of development.

<h3 id="r-rating-or-not-the-batman-is-still-going-to-be-fucking-incredible">R rating or not, the batman is still going to be fucking incredible.</h3><p>There isn�t much in this barren land where he and his wife, naameh (jennifer connelly), are raising their three children, shem, ham and infant japeth. This isn�t the clean, harmless version we were presented with as kids, which is a good thing. As a descendent of one of adam and eve�s sons, noah (russell crowe) is a protector of the creator�s prediluvian world, consuming only what he needs and can use, and nothing more. The truth is that we felt we were properly able to represent the edge and power that black adam has without needing to go to an r rating. No glib, predictable solutions here, which is one reason why the film�s events linger in your mind.</p>
