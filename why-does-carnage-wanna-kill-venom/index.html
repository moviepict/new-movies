</center> <p><strong>Why Does Carnage Wanna Kill Venom</strong>, Carnage seemed the superior symbiote to venom in nearly every regard, so how did he lose to venom? The event has proven to be the culmination of years of stories, with donny cates and ryan stegman�s run on the venom series creating a brand new mythology surrounding knull, the dark god of symbiotes. When eddie brock escaped prison after being reunited with the venom symbiote, it left behind the first of its offspring.</p>

<p>Venom also, at times, does not want the symbiote to spread, and has actively hunted down other symbiotes. Let there be carnage, your answer would be yes. They live together in secret, but venom can�t kill people, so while they have superhero potential, they. This could explain why venom is so fearful of facing an enemy with a ruddy hue.</p>

<p>Which would show about how both venom and carnage are related to each other, like a family together, which is why venom was terrified of carnage and didn�t want to hurt him, but decided to, because symbiote�s are designed for them to feel hate, eevn though venom has changed his behaviour, carnage did not. Because venom is in a symbiotic relationship with its host, while carnage doesn�t give a shit and just hijacks yo ass. This could explain why venom is so fearful of facing an enemy with a ruddy hue. Venom decided that, in order to completely remove the threat of carnage from the world, he would have to devour and absorb carnage completely. The reason why carnage is red is because it entered cletus through his bloodstream. Carnage seemed the superior symbiote to venom in nearly every regard, so how did he lose to venom?</p>
