<p>Pin by Brandon Calene on DC Nation celebration 75,Years, For the most part, though there are some similarities between their biggest characters like thor and superman, but they�re kind of a stretch to be totally honest.

<h3 id="mary-marvel-is-captain-marvel039s-female-counterpart-like-supergirl-is-superman039s-female-counterpart">Mary marvel is captain marvel�s female counterpart like supergirl is superman�s female counterpart.</h3><p>Every one of these guys have at one time or another been called marvel’s superman. Trained with shield and earning a phd in biology, mockingbird is a diverse agent who once was married to hawkeye. Marvel and dc characters who are similar. Both had wifes who loved everything about them. As far as personality goes i�d probably have to go with the green goblin or carnage.</p>
